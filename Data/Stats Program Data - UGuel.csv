MATH 1160,Linear Algebra I,0.5,"This course provides an introduction to linear algebra in Euclidean space. Topics covered include: N-dimensional vectors, dot product, matrices and matrix operations, systems of linear equations and Gaussian elimination, linear independence, subspaces, basis and dimension, matrix inverse, matrix rank and determinant, eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonalization, orthogonalization and projections, linear transformations. Some fundamental proofs and applications of these topics will be included.",4U Calculus and Vectors or 4U Advanced Functions,"ENGG*1500, MATH*2150, MATH*2160",MATH,1.0,R,MT,NA
STAT 2040,Statistics I,0.5,"This course focuses on the practical methods of Statistics and the topics include: descriptive statistics; univariate models such as binomial, Poisson, uniform and normal; the central limit theorem; expected value; the t, F and chi-square models; point and interval estimation; hypothesis testing methods up to two-sample data; simple regression and correlation; introduction to analysis of variance. Assignments will deal with real data from the natural sciences and involve the use of statistical software for computing and visualization.","1 of 4U Calculus and Vectors, Advanced Functions and Calculus, OAC Calculus, MATH*1080","STAT*1000, STAT*2060, STAT*2080, STAT*2100, STAT*2120",STAT,2.0,R,"SM, SP",NA
STAT 2050,Statistics II,0.5,"In this course, students will learn how to implement good study design and analyze data from complex studies. This course follows naturally from STAT*2040 and features both previously unseen statistical techniques, as well as studying in greater depth some topics covered in STAT*2040. These topics will include: experiments and observational studies; a review of t-tests and confidence intervals; confounding variables; association and causality; Analysis of Variance (ANOVA); simple and multiple linear regression; binary responses (logistic regression); odds ratios and relative risk; and an introduction to experimental design (including blocked designs and factorial treatment designs). Assignments carried out using modern statistical software will form the basis for mastering the material.",STAT 2040,"BIOL*2250, STAT*2090, STAT*2250",STAT,2.0,R,"SM, SP",NA
STAT 3100,Introductory Mathematical Statistics I,0.5,"The topics covered in this course include: Probability spaces; discrete and continuous random variables; multivariate distributions; expectations; moments, Chebyshev's inequality, product moments; sums of random variables, generating functions; Gamma, Beta, t and F distributions; central limit theorem; sampling distributions.","(1 of IPS*1510, MATH*1210, MATH*2080), (STAT*2040 or STAT*2120)",None,"MATH, STAT",3.0,R,"MT, PT, ST",NA
STAT 3110,Introductory Mathematical Statistics II,0.5,"Estimation, unbiasedness, Cramer-Rao inequality, consistency, sufficiency, method of moments, maximum likelihood estimation; hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson lemma, likelihood ratio test, uniformly most powerful test; linear regression and correlation; non-parametric methods.",STAT 3100,None,"MATH, STAT",3.0,R,"MT, ST",NA
STAT 3240,Applied Regression Analysis,0.5,"This course reviews simple linear regression and introduces multiple regression with emphasis on theory of least squares estimation, residual analysis, and model interpretation. Within the multiple regression context, transformations of variables, interactions, model selection techniques, ANOVA, influence diagnostics and multicollinearity will be discussed. Topics may also include Box-Cox transformations, weighted regression, and logistic and Poisson regression. This course is supplemented with computer labs involving interactive data analysis using statistical software.","(1 of IPS*1510, MATH*1210, MATH*2080), (1 of MATH*1160, MATH*2150, MATH*2160), STAT*2050",None,STAT,3.0,R,"CS, SM, SP",NA
