CMPT 141,Introduction to Computer Science,0.5,"An introduction to computer science and problem solving using procedural programming. This course introduces the basic computer science and computer programming principles of algorithms, abstraction, encapsulation, variables, conditional branching, repetition, functions, recursion, and elementary data structures. These concepts are applied to problem solving applications such as data analysis and visualization, simulation, text processing, and image processing. The programming skills acquired in this course are applicable in all fields of study, the work-place, and personal projects.","One of (Computer Science 30, CMPT 105, CMPT 140) and one of (Mathematics B30, Foundations of Mathematics 30, Pre-Calculus 30); or MATH 110 or MATH 123 (can be taken concurrently).",None,COMP,1,R,CS,NA
CMPT 145,Principles of Computer Science,0.5,"This course builds on CMPT 141 by introducing additional problem solving methods and computer science principles, to solve larger problems that are more data intensive, or require more sophisticated techniques. These principles include data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of data, selection of appropriate data structures, algorithmic paradigms for solving difficult problems, and analysis of algorithms time and space requirements. This course also emphasizes fundamental principles of coding style, testing, and top-down design for writing robust, maintainable software",CMPT 141; or CMPT 111 and permission of the department.,CMPT 270,COMP,1,R,CS,NA
