CMPUT 174,Introduction to the Foundations of Computation I,0.5,"Emphasis is on the underlying process behind the solution, independent of programming language or style. Basic notions of state, control flow, data structures, recursion, modularization, and testing are introduced through solving simple problems in a variety of domains such as text analysis, map navigation, game search, simulation, and cryptography. Students learn to program by reading and modifying existing programs as well as writing new ones. No prior programming experience is necessary.",MATH 30 or 30-1,None,COMP,1,R,CS,
CMPUT 175,Introduction to the Foundations of Computation II,0.5,"A continuation of CMPUT 174, revisiting topics of greater depth and complexity. More sophisticated notions such as objects, functional programming, time and memory consumption, and user interface building are explored.
