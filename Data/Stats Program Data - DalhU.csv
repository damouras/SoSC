MATH 1000,Differential and Integral Calculus I,0.5,"This course offers a self-contained introduction to differential and integral calculus. The topics include functions, limits, differentiation of polynomial, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions, product, quotient and chain rules, applications of differentiation, antiderivatives and definite integrals, integration by substitution.
